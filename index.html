                <p>
                    Diving deeper, the situation is exacerbated by the overwhelming medical debt that plagues many Americans. 
                    Our visualizations depict how different states fare in terms of median medical debt. The median began 
                    to slowly decrease after 2014 when the Affordable Care Act was expanded in all but 10 states.
                    Despite some decreases following healthcare reforms, the persistent high levels of debt on top of 
                    annual healthcare cost of $ 13,493 per person as shown in bar chart above underline a systemic failure to 
                    protect the most vulnerable.

                <h2>Exploring Denied Claims: Which company reaps the most benefits in 2023?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Following the scrutiny of healthcare quality, another critical issue emerges: the 
                    alarming rate of denied claims by insurance companies. Let's delve into the denial patterns 
                    among leading insurers, exploring how such practices boost their profits at the expense of consumers. 
                    We aim to expose the struggles of policyholders who frequently have to fight for the coverage they paid 
                    for and deserve. This ongoing battle not only exacerbates financial burdens but also deepens the 
                    public's mistrust and resentment towards these powerful healthcare entities.

                            Aetna is also guilty of denying claims for life-saving procedures. In one case, a policyholder shared "she was

            By inspecting these pain points, it becomes more clear how many issues Americans face in their 
            health care, especially when compared with other dveloped countries. Among the various companies, UnitedHealthcare 
            shows a pattern of high profit but poor service, from having the highest revenue among top insurance companies, to 
            displaying the highest rates of denied claims. These growing issues shed light on the general public's outcry against 
            UnitedHealthcare.
