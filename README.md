# Healthcare Data Visualization Project  

## Overview  
This project was developed as part of a class at Cornell University. It analyzes the relationship between public sentiment and the American healthcare system, focusing on the insurance sector using web scraping, data processing, and interactive visualizations.  

Key features:  
âœ… **Web Scraping** â€“ Extracts data from sources like ProPublica, Statista, and other online reports using `BeautifulSoup`.  
âœ… **Data Processing** â€“ Cleans and structures datasets with `Pandas` for analysis.  
âœ… **Interactive Data Visualization** â€“ Uses `D3.js` and `JavaScript` to create engaging graphs.
